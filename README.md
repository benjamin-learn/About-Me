# About-Me

Hey there, I'm Benjamin, a Technical Business Analyst employed at Accenture in Singapore. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), where I graduated with Distinction.

I find great joy in the fusion of design and development. The ability to conceive an idea and subsequently create it is truly liberating.
